## Why CoreZero

Creating high-quality components that offer the best user experience is crucial for businesses building modern applications. However, many teams focus on business logic, often relying on headless component libraries for these components.

**Most existing headless open-source solutions are either too rigid or too flexible.** Headless components should be simple to use, as basic functionality often meets most requirements. They should also allow for advanced customization when complex needs arise. Since requirements can change, a library should support all these aspects, emphasizing flexibility.

Existing open-source solutions lack sufficient flexibility. Therefore, we **decided to gradually develop highly flexible headless components usable in any project.** This effort resulted in CoreZero.

## Feature

- **Simple**: Provides fully functional components that can be used immediately without any configuration. By default, it complies with WAI-ARIA standards and offers high-quality interactions across various devices.
- **Controlled**: Offers custom hooks combined with components, allowing users to have complete control over the component when desired. This operates similarly to the props getter pattern.
- **Styling**: Headless components track various states to enable users to apply appropriate styling. These states are exposed through Data-attributes and render props.
- **Flexible**: Allows flexible customization of components and logic to suit the user's environment
